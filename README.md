## 777luckykat: my personal website!
this is my personal website named after my username(well not my github username but my username on most of my platforms LOL): 777luckykat! there's some art, projects i'm working on, and some other stuff about me :D I wanted to make this website to display all the stuff i've been working on and basically just show off fun facts about me. I was inspired by people's personal websites from the 2000s/early 2010s, which are always flashy and have a lot of cute graphics, and I wanted to make a website that was somewhat modern but also still had lots of flashy and cute things!
### how i made my project
i used Visual Studio Code as my editor, and used HTML/CSS + JS to code my website! I also used the Vite plugin and TailwindCSS. This was my first time using TailwindCSS and Vite, and it was pretty easy to setup so I'll definitely be using those again :)
### struggles + things i learned
- it was an absolute struggle to ship this website... I didn't realize I had to upload my fonts + background images to the "public" folder before running "npm run build" and i was really confused the whole time and it took like 3 hours
- my containers are draggable and that was a huge struggle for me to script because I took some JS classes 6 years ago and forgot everything...
- i learned that i could make custom classes in TailwindCSS and that helped me a lot with scripting so that was nice!
### notes/disclaimers for visitors!!
- disclaimer: it takes a while to load
- this website is made to work on desktop/laptop/tablet so if you're viewing on mobile it might be a bit janky, worked pretty hard on it though so enjoy ^^
